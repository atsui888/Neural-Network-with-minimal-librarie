# Neural-Network-with-minimal-libraries (still WIP)
My implementation of Neural Network using as few libraries as possible (only numpy so far), because there are some secured environments where access to some libraries/packages are restricted or where running a pyinstaller created .exe (with those tensorflow, pytorch etc in it) take an excessively long time to start up for inferencing and then users become annoyed.

To add:
- Back propagation for hidden layers (currently only back prop for perceptron)
- Multiprocessing
- Test against MNIST
- load/save dictionary of (layers, weights, bias, normalisation)
- More Activation and Cost functions
